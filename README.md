# insomnia-plugin-timestamp-expander

Simple plugin for insomnia that tries to spot timestamp and add them to response as iso strings.

I was fed up with seeing timestamps that made no sense to me!
This plugin tries to spot timestamps in json output and add a new property with the timestamp as an ISO string.

At the moment, it only really works on json output. ðŸ¤·
